						<p>Alex Webb, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>
						
						<blockquote>
						  <p>Apple Inc. has cut the approval time for new submissions to its
						App Store from more than a week to less than two days, part of a
						broader push to increase revenue from services including mobile
						applications.</p>
						
						<p>The accelerated pace allows app developers to fix bugs faster, try
						out new features more regularly and better react to market
						changes, while building developer loyalty to Apple’s iOS mobile
						operating system. The mean approval time has fallen from 8.8 days
						a year ago to 1.95 days in the past two weeks, according to
						<a href="http://appreviewtimes.com/">AppReviewTimes.com</a>, which analyzes user-submitted data. In
						December, the average was more than five days.</p>
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>Wonder how Apple is achieving this. More reviewers? Lower standards?</p>
						
						<p><strong>Update:</strong> I don’t get this: “part of a broader push to increase revenue from services”. I don’t see how shorter review times will increase Apple’s revenue. If anything, it might be costing them more, since the most obvious way they could achieve this is by hiring more reviewers. In some companies everything is a cost center, but not at Apple. If these review times are not just a statistical fluke, the simplest explanation for why is that Apple is responding to long-standing complaints from developers. Remember too, that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10412204/apple-phil-schiller-now-leads-app-store">App Store leadership moved from Eddy Cue to Phil Schiller</a> just a few months ago.</p>

						<h2> <a href=#>Gboard</a> </h2>
						
						<time>Thursday, 12 May 2016</time>
						
						<p><a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/gboard-search-gifs-emojis-keyboard.html">Rajan Patel, lead engineer for Google’s new iOS keyboard</a>:</p>
						
						<blockquote>
						  <p>Say you’re texting with a friend about tomorrow’s lunch plans.
						They ask you for the address. Until now it’s worked like this: You
						leave your texting app. Open Search. Find the restaurant. Copy the
						address. Switch back to your texts. Paste the address into a
						message. And finally, hit send.</p>
						
						<p>Searching and sending stuff on your phone shouldn’t be that
						difficult. With Gboard, you can search and send all kinds of
						things — restaurant info, flight times, news articles — right
						from your keyboard. Anything you’d search on Google, you can
						search with Gboard. Results appear as cards with the key
						information front and center, such as the phone number, ratings
						and hours. With one tap, you can send it to your friend and you
						keep the conversation going.</p>
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>My first thought, of course, was “<em>Sounds like a privacy disaster — Google will see and log everything people type with this keyboard.</em>”</p>
						
						<p>But that doesn’t seem to be the case. During setup, Gboard displays <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2016/05/gboard-privacy.jpg">this</a> simple privacy statement, regarding its need for you to grant it “full access”, including networking:</p>
						
						<blockquote>
						  <p>This lets you use Google Search in your keyboard. Your searches
						are sent to Google, but nothing else you type is.</p>
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>Here’s what Google says in the app’s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gboard-search.-gifs.-emojis/id1091700242?mt=8">description in the App Store</a>:</p>
						
						<blockquote>
						  <p>Privacy</p>
						
						<p>We know the things you type on your phone are personal, so we’ve
						designed Gboard to keep your private information private.</p>
						
						<p>What Gboard sends to Google:</p>
						
						<ul>
						<li>When you do a search, Gboard sends your query to Google’s web
						servers so Google can process your query and send you search
						results.</li>
						<li>Gboard also sends anonymous statistics to Google to help us
						diagnose problems when the app crashes and to let us know which
						features are used most often.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>What Gboard doesn’t send to Google:</p>
						
						<ul>
						<li>Everything else. Gboard will remember words you type to help you
						with spelling or to predict searches you might be interested in,
						but this data is stored only on your device. This data is not
						accessible by Google or by any apps other than Gboard.</li>
						</ul>
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>This privacy policy could change in the future, of course. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd8hy032uLc">Deals can be altered</a>, and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424052970204880404577225380456599176-lMyQjAxMTAyMDEwNjExNDYyWj.html">Google’s history of deliberately circumventing iOS privacy features is well-documented</a>. But right now, it looks like Gboard is actually private. In fact, so far as I can tell, not only are you not required to sign into a Google account to use it — there is no way to sign in to a Google account <em>even if you wanted to</em>. Queries sent through Gboard don’t show up in <a href="https://history.google.com/history/?hl=en">my Google search history</a>, even when I’m signed into my Google account in other Google iOS apps. Only what you type in Gboard’s search input field gets sent to Google, and even that is always sent anonymously.</p>
						
						<p>Whether this is Google’s own magnanimous decision, a technical limitation in iOS, or a policy decision enforced by App Store review, I don’t know.</p>
						
						<p>Other notes:</p>
						
						<ul>
						<li><p>Gboard is iOS-only for now, <a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2016/05/12/not-cool-google-googles-gboard-awesome-new-keyboard-ios-may-come-android/">but Android users seem to want it</a>.</p></li>
						<li><p>Design-wise Gboard is a little weird. All of Google’s recent iOS apps use Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a> visual language, including the Roboto font. Their iOS apps look and work a lot more like Android apps than iOS apps. Gboard, however, was visually designed to mimic the standard iOS keyboard very closely. Gboard sports slightly different colors and changes a few key placements,<sup id="fnr1-2016-05-12"><a href="#fn1-2016-05-12">1</a></sup> but is clearly designed to look like the familiar system keyboard — I’ll bet many users will think Gboard is only adding a search bar above the system keyboard. (Third-party keyboards in iOS can’t merely modify the system keyboard — they must reimplement just about everything from scratch.<sup id="fnr2-2016-05-12"><a href="#fn2-2016-05-12">2</a></sup>)</p>
						
						<p>But Gboard uses Roboto instead of SF. The differences between Roboto and San Francisco are sometimes subtle, but to my eyes it just makes it look out of place on iOS 9. Also, they chose too thin of a weight of Roboto — I can barely see the period on their “.” key. I think the whole Material Design thing feels terribly out of place on iOS. I’m glad they didn’t do with it Gboard, but they should have gone the whole way and used San Francisco for the typeface, too.</p></li>
						<li><p>Gboard has some <a href="http://www.cnet.com/how-to/5-reasons-to-install-googles-keyboard-on-your-ios-device/">interesting emoji features</a>. First, rather than make you switch to a different keyboard, it has its own dedicated emoji layout built in, including search. Mac OS’s “Emoji and Symbols” picker has long allowed for search; it’s long struck me as a little curious that iOS’s standard emoji keyboard does not. Second, Gboard’s predictive text feature will suggest emoji in addition to actual words. Type “dinner” and the first predictive suggestion is “🍴”; type “basketball” and you get “🏀”. That’s clever.</p></li>
						<li><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/730946152309395459">Federico Viticci</a>: “There must be people at Google who <em>really</em> don’t get the iPad. Gboard is very good on the iPhone; the layout is atrocious on the iPad Pro.” I didn’t even think to try it on an iPad — for some reason I’ve got it in my head that third-party keyboards are an iPhone-only thing on iOS.</p></li>
						<li><p><strong>Update 2:</strong> [Rajan Patel, on Twitter][rp], regarding this article:</p>
						
						<blockquote>
						  <p>@daringfireball It was our magnanimous decision, we should go all
						the way w/ design, and we will polish iPad.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Gboard’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/05/gboard">★</a></p>

							<p>Example: Gboard uses a smaller return key with the “⏎” glyph as a label; iOS uses a bigger key labeled “Return” — but they’re both in the same location, the lower-right corner. Gboard uses the extra space created by its smaller Return key to add a “.” key to the alphabetic keyboard; press and hold on it and you get shortcuts for a bunch of common punctuation characters.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2016-05-12" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p>
